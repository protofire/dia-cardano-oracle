# Milestone 1 Preview Evidence

Source of truth: [`final-cardano-milestones.md`](./final-cardano-milestones.md)

Scope: Milestone 1 validation on Cardano Preview. Cardano mainnet deployment and final mainnet evidence are not included in this Preview evidence file.

Verification date: 2026-04-25T10:23:34Z; updated 2026-04-26

Network: Cardano Preview

## Official Milestone 1 Outputs

| Official output | Repository status |
| --- | --- |
| Aiken oracle smart contract ported to Cardano UTxO model | Complete |
| Compiled contract | Complete: `contracts/aiken/plutus.json` |
| Unit/integration test coverage | Complete for current repository scope: `aiken check` passes 24/24 tests; CLI tests pass |
| Deployment scripts | Complete: `offchain/cli` runbook and CLI commands |
| Documentation for Cardano developers | Complete in repository: root README, Aiken README, CLI runbook, architecture document |
| Verified Cardano mainnet deployment and execution hashes | Pending: mainnet not executed yet |

## Current Verification

- `aiken check`: 24/24 tests passed.
- `npm run test`: passed in `offchain/cli`.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed in `offchain/cli`.
- `npm run build`: passed in `offchain/cli`.
- Preview transactions must be regenerated with the clarified init + parameterize + bootstrap + reference-script deployment flow before this evidence is marked complete.

## Local State Artifacts

- `offchain/cli/state/preview/config-bootstrap.json`
- `offchain/cli/state/preview/clients/client-a.json`
- `offchain/cli/state/preview/clients/client-a/pairs/usdc-usd.json`

## Notes

Each DIA `OracleIntent` signature is valid only for the exact payload it signs, including `symbol`, `price`, `timestamp`, and `nonce`. The first Preview update uses the available DIA fixture intent and signature for one `USDC/USD` update. Later updates require newer `timestamp` and `nonce` values, so the batch update validation uses an Ethereum/EIP-712 test signer that was added to the authorized signer set through the Config update transaction for Preview validation.

Reference-script UTxOs must be created at the `reference_holder` script address derived from `contracts/aiken/plutus.json`. The deploy wallet funds those outputs but cannot spend them.

Mainnet evidence must be recorded after the final transaction flow is executed on Cardano mainnet.
